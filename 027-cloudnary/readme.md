# Setting Up Cloudinary in a Node.js Express Project

This guide will walk you through the steps to set up Cloudinary in a Node.js Express project for managing images and other media files.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 12 or later)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
- An [Express](https://expressjs.com/) project (you can set one up by following the [Express documentation](https://expressjs.com/en/starter/installing.html))
- A [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/) account

## 1. Install Required Packages

First, navigate to your project directory and install the necessary npm packages:

```bash
npm install express dotenv cloudinary multer
```

- `express`: Web framework for Node.js.
- `dotenv`: Module to load environment variables from a `.env` file into `process.env`.
- `cloudinary`: Official Cloudinary SDK for Node.js.
- `multer`: Middleware for handling `multipart/form-data`, which is primarily used for uploading files.

## 2. Set Up Cloudinary Account

1. Go to [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/), sign up, and log in.
2. Navigate to your **Programmable media(Top left icon ) >> Getting started**.
3. Click on the **View API KEYS**.
4. Copy the `Cloud name`, `API Key`, and `API Secret`.

## 3. Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root of your project and add the following variables:

```plaintext
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloud_name
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_api_key
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_api_secret
```

Replace `your_cloud_name`, `your_api_key`, and `your_api_secret` with the actual values from your Cloudinary dashboard.

## 4. Set Up Cloudinary in Your Project

Create a new file called `cloudinaryConfig.js` in your project's `config` directory (or any directory you prefer) and add the following code:

```javascript
const cloudinary = require('cloudinary').v2;
require('dotenv').config();

cloudinary.config({
  cloud_name: process.env.CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME,
  api_key: process.env.CLOUDINARY_API_KEY,
  api_secret: process.env.CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET,
});

module.exports = cloudinary;
```

## 5. Create a File Upload Route

In your `routes` directory, create a file called `upload.js` and add the following code:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const multer = require('multer');
const cloudinary = require('../config/cloudinaryConfig');
const router = express.Router();

const storage = multer.memoryStorage();

const upload = multer({ storage });

router.post('/upload', upload.single('image'), async (req, res) => {
    try {
        const streamUpload = (req) => {
            return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
                const stream = cloudinary.uploader.upload_stream((error, result) => {
                    if (result) {
                        resolve(result);
                    } else {
                        reject(error);
                    }
                });
                streamifier.createReadStream(req.file.buffer).pipe(stream);
            });
        };
        const result = await streamUpload(req);
        res.json({
            message: 'Image uploaded successfully',
            url: result.secure_url,
        });
    } catch (error) {
        res.status(500).json({ error: 'Failed to upload image' });
    }
});

module.exports = router;
```

## 6. Integrate the Upload Route

In your main `app.js` or `server.js` file, add the following code to integrate the upload route:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const uploadRoute = require('./routes/upload');
const app = express();

app.use(express.json());
app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: true }));

app.use('/api', uploadRoute);

const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;
app.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`Server running on port ${PORT}`);
});
```

## 7. Test the Setup

Start your server:

```bash
node app.js
```

You can test the file upload by sending a `POST` request to `http://localhost:3000/api/upload` with an image file in the form-data with the key `image`.

## Conclusion

You have successfully set up Cloudinary in your Node.js Express project. You can now manage your media files easily with Cloudinary's powerful API.
